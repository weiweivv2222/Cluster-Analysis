# K-Mean clustering analysis
It works on the same objects as hierarchical clustering analysis. The difference is we need to set the centers in the dataset
before we implement it. Also everytime the start points is randomly, so it is better to set the seed for each time.
code: set.seed(123)
kClust = kmeans(dataFrame, centers=6, nstart=100)
table(kClust$cluster, sub1$activity)

Notes: 
# We can plot center of the kClust in order to find which feature is most significant.
