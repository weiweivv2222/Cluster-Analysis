# Hierarchical Clustering Analysis
It is one type of clustering analysis, which focus on data frame and matrix data set. The procedure for doing it is given by
*To get the distance in your data set, there are many different "distance measure", such as "euclidean" (which is the default
method in R), "maximum" and "manhattan".
code: dis = dist(subdataFrame, method="euclidean")

* After you have the distance between different data points, then we can divide the cluster for the data set.
code: hclustering = hclust(dis, method="complete"), methods can be changed.

* The last step is to plot the clustering tree using plot function
code: plot(hclustering, lab.col=?)
Notes: 
1) the object is used in dist function should be numerical
2) We can plot clustering tree with colors using "myplclust" function.
3) If the clustering tree does not seems clearly seperate the data set, you can using the Singular Value Decomposition to 
   find the most contributor variable in the dataFrame except the subdataFrame, then adding it to dist function. Doing the
   same as before. Be aware of here the data frame include multiple variables, and we use hiearchical clustering only on some sub data.
