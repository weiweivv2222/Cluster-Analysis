The connection between PCA and Clustering analysis 
* The correlation coefficient matrix, we can start to analysis the dependence between components
* PCA on data frame (numerical): more convinece step to find the significant components
* summary of the PCA results (pc). According to Cumulative proportion, we are able to make a descision which and how many
  components are significant.
*biplot(pc) to visulize the relation 
* Then we can plot 3d graphics to investigate relations of components

*K-Mean clustering analysis (from the PCA, we know how many centers we use for K-Mean clustering analysis)
*hierarchical clustering
*with(dataFrame, table(cluster, factorvariable) to finish the analysis.
